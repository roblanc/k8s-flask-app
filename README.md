# k8s-flask-app

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline for a containerized Python **Flask web application** deployed onto a Kubernetes cluster (using Minikube/K3s for local development).

## What We Did

| Component | Goal | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Application** | Created a minimal Python Flask app (`app.py`) designed to read environment variables for versioning. | Built a **Dockerfile** to containerize the application, exposing it on port 8080. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Automated the build, test, and push process upon code commit. | Configured a **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`build-and-push.yaml`) to automatically log into Docker Hub, build the image, and push it with two tags: **`:latest`** and a unique **Short Commit SHA** (`db58ece`). |
| **Deployment** | Defined the necessary resources to run the application securely and scalably in Kubernetes. | Created `app-deploy.yaml` defining a **Deployment** (for replicas) and a **NodePort Service** (to expose the application). |

| **Observability** | Prepared the environment for production-grade monitoring. | Installed **Helm** and added the necessary repository to deploy Prometheus and Grafana. |

## Current Status

The CI/CD pipeline is **fully functional and robust**. The application is currently running and verified with the latest code, accessible via NodePort.

*   **Application:** Flask App V2 (**`Hello from Flask in K8s!FINAL V2 TEST`**) is successfully running.
*   **Deployment:** Managed by the `flask-app-deployment` using image tag `netrebnic/web-app:db58ece`.
*   **Tools Ready:** `kubectl`, `helm` (v3.19.0), and a local Kubernetes environment (Minikube/K3s) are configured.
    *   **Helm Explained:** Helm acts as the package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying the deployment and management of applications by using "Charts" to define, install, and upgrade even complex Kubernetes applications.
*   **Next Phase:** Monitoring and resource optimization are ready to begin.

## Next Steps and Roadmap

The next phase of the project is to enhance production readiness by implementing **Observability** and optimizing the infrastructure.

### Phase 1: Observability (Monitoring) üìä

1.  **Deploy Prometheus and Grafana:** Complete the monitoring stack deployment using Helm, placing all components in the `monitoring` namespace.
2.  **Configure Access:** Set up port forwarding to access the Grafana web interface and use the generated `admin` password.
3.  **Validate Metrics:** Explore the default dashboards to verify metrics are being collected from the Kubernetes control plane and node resources.

### Phase 2: Production Readiness & Optimization ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Resource Limits:** Update `app-deploy.yaml` to define specific `requests` and `limits` for CPU and Memory. This prevents the Flask application from consuming excessive resources and destabilizing the node.
2.  **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Deploy an HPA resource to automatically scale the `flask-app-deployment` up or down based on CPU utilization, ensuring the application can handle traffic spikes.
3.  **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Add `livenessProbe` (to restart failed containers) and `readinessProbe` (to control service traffic) to the Deployment manifest.
4.  **Ingress:** Replace the less efficient NodePort Service with an **Ingress resource** backed by an Ingress Controller (like NGINX), allowing traffic to be routed based on hostnames or paths on a single IP/port.

## Troubleshooting

### Minikube Image Pull / DNS Resolution Issues

**Symptoms:**
*   `Failing to connect to https://registry.k8s.io/ from inside the minikube container`
*   `Error: ErrImagePull`
*   `Failed to pull image`
*   `dial tcp: lookup registry.k8s.io on ...: server misbehaving`

**Cause:**
Minikube environment is unable to resolve external DNS or reach image registries, often due to local network configuration, firewall, or proxy settings.

**Solution:**
1.  **Verify Host Internet Connectivity:** Ensure your host machine has unrestricted internet access and can reach `https://registry.k8s.io` directly.
2.  **Check Firewall/Antivirus:** Temporarily disable any firewall or antivirus software on your host machine to see if it's blocking Minikube's network traffic.
3.  **Restart Minikube:** A fresh start can sometimes resolve underlying network issues.
    ```bash
    minikube delete && minikube start --driver=docker --memory=3072mb
    ```
4.  **Consult Minikube Documentation:** Refer to the official Minikube documentation for network troubleshooting, especially if you are behind a corporate proxy or have custom DNS settings.
5.  **Consider a Different Minikube Driver:** If the `docker` driver continues to have issues, you might consider trying `minikube start --driver=kvm2` (if KVM is installed) or `minikube start --driver=virtualbox` (if VirtualBox is installed).
